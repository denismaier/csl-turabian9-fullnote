  {"id":"kengExpandingCollegeAccess2017","abstract":"Between 1990 and 2014, Taiwan increased the college share of its labor force from 7 to 32 percent by converting junior colleges to 4-year colleges. Such a rapid surge in skill supply should suppress college wages and lower wage income inequality. Instead, wage inequality rose 7 percent since 1978. We show that the surge of weaker college graduates made them poor substitutes for better-trained college graduates and led to an increase in wage inequality within skill groups. Rising wage inequality due to increased variation in the quality of young college graduates added another source of inequality to the Taiwan labor market. The Taiwan case shows that increasing college access alone will not lower inequality.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Keng","given":"Shao-Hsun"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Chun-Hung"},{"family":"Orazem","given":"Peter F."}],"container-title":"Journal of Human Capital","container-title-short":"Journal of Human Capital","DOI":"10.1086/690235","ISSN":"1932-8575","issue":"1","issued":{"season":1,"date-parts":[[2017]]},"page":"1-34","publisher":"The University of Chicago Press","source":"journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)","title":"Expanding College Access in Taiwan, 1978–2014: Effects on Graduate Quality and Income Inequality","title-short":"Expanding College Access in Taiwan, 1978–2014","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/690235","volume":"11"},

Fast Food Nation points the way but, to resurrect an old fast food slogan, the choice is yours.\"--Los Angeles Times In 2001, Fast Food Nation was published to critical acclaim and became an international bestseller. Eric Schlosser's exposé revealed how the fast food industry has altered the landscape of America, widened the gap between rich and poor, fueled an epidemic of obesity, and transformed food production throughout the world. The book changed the way millions of people think about what they eat and helped to launch today's food movement. In a new afterword for this edition, Schlosser discusses the growing interest in local and organic food, the continued exploitation of poor workers by the food industry, and the need to ensure that every American has access to good, healthy, affordable food. Fast Food Nation is as relevant today as it was a decade ago. The book inspires readers to look beneath the surface of our food system, consider its impact on society and, most of all, think for themselves. \"As disturbing as it is irresistible . . .

  {"id":"weberResistGloballyInfect2017","abstract":"Parasite infections are a product of both ecological processes affecting host-parasite encounter rates and evolutionary dynamics affecting host susceptibility. However, few studies examine natural infection variation from both ecological and evolutionary perspectives. Here, we describe the ecological and evolutionary factors generating variation in infection rates by a tapeworm (Schistocephalus solidus) in a vertebrate host, the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). To explore ecological aspects of infection, we measured tapeworm prevalence in Canadian stickleback inhabiting two distinct environments: marine and freshwater. Consistent with ecological control of infection, the tapeworm is very rare in marine environments, even though marine fish are highly susceptible. Conversely, commonly infected freshwater stickleback exhibit substantial resistance in controlled laboratory trials, suggesting that high exposure risk overwhelms their recently evolved resistance. We also tested for parasite adaptation to its host by performing transcontinental reciprocal infections, using stickleback and tapeworm populations from Europe and western Canada. More infections occurred in same-continent host-parasite combinations, indicating parasite “local” adaptation, at least on the scale of continents. However, the recently evolved immunity of freshwater hosts applies to both local and foreign parasites. The pattern of adaptation described here is not wholly compatible with either of the common models of host-parasite coevolution (i.e., matching infection or targeted recognition). Instead, we propose a hybrid, eco-evolutionary model to explain the remarkable pattern of global host resistance and local parasite infectivity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Weber","given":"Jesse N."},{"family":"Kalbe","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Shim","given":"Kum Chuan"},{"family":"Erin","given":"Noémie I."},{"family":"Steinel","given":"Natalie C."},{"family":"Ma","given":"Lei"},{"family":"Bolnick","given":"Daniel I."}],"container-title":"American Naturalist","container-title-short":"The American Naturalist","DOI":"10.1086/689597","ISSN":"0003-0147","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,1]]},"page":"43-57","publisher":"The University of Chicago Press","source":"journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)","title":"Resist Globally, Infect Locally: A Transcontinental Test of Adaptation by Stickleback and Their Tapeworm Parasite","title-short":"Resist Globally, Infect Locally","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/689597","volume":"189"}
